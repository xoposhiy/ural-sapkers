============ SAPKA PRECONFIGURATION HELP =============
 All commands are separated by ';' character.
 Some commands will need parameters, which can be specified by adding ' ' (space)
character.

 To configure SAPKA, input 'config <config-token>[#<config-token>...];'.
 All configuration tokens can be found in your manual at page 42. It was reviewed by
Caesar.

 To load DMA tokens, input 'dma <dma-token>[#<dma-token>...];'.

 To access memory, input 'memconfig;'
 To launch SAPKA, input 'launch;'
 You can use 'launch <team-name> <config-token>[#<config-token> ...];'
 to launch SAPKA instantly before defining the team name with the 'team' command.'

 NOTE: It's strongly recommended to configure SAPKA before launching,
       and always use as many configuration tokens and dma tokens as you can.
